# PR Merge Strategies

There are 3 merge strategies in GitHub:

1. Merge
2. Squash and Merge
3. Rebase and merge

## Rebase and Merge

This is my preferred strategy for small repos with only a handful concurrent contributors. This makes for a linear and clean main tree which for a small team can outweigh the benefits of merge commits.

The caveat here is that it requires a bit of extra overhead for interacting with.
